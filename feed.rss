While most were very expensive, I eventually stumbled on some at AliExpress by searching for the term ‘Miniature Slide Screw Stepper’ or ‘linear stepper’ and various combinations of similar words. They looked ideal so I bought some, similar to these:]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[John Appleseed]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Turnout Control]]></category><category><![CDATA[Linear Stepper Motors]]></category></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.example.com/2018/2018-05-21-muscle-wire-update</guid><title>Muscle Wire Update</title><link>https://www.example.com/2018/2018-05-21-muscle-wire-update</link><description><![CDATA[This now happened quite a while ago now but as luck would have it, barely a week after I made my last post on using muscle wire for turnout actuators my last bit of wire broke :-(   It was a bit of a shame really, as the test rig had operated for months without any problems.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[John Appleseed]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Turnout Control]]></category><category><![CDATA[Muscle Wire]]></category></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.example.com/2018/2018-05-20-muscle-wire</guid><title>Muscle Wire to Operate Turnouts</title><link>https://www.example.com/2018/2018-05-20-muscle-wire</link><description><![CDATA[Well I know I haven’t posted much in a while, but rest assured there have been exciting developments going on over here on a number of fronts.]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 20 May 2018 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[John Appleseed]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Turnout Control]]></category><category><![CDATA[Muscle Wire]]></category></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.example.com/2018/2018-04-15-rc-servos</guid><title>RC Servos to Operate Turnouts</title><link>https://www.example.com/2018/2018-04-15-rc-servos</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve been working on low cost ways to control turnouts.

I probably would have thought of it earlier but I only just got the Dremel for Christmas and wasn’t really familiar with it. I quickly grabbed a short piece of rail, put it in a vice and stuck a No. 409 grinding disk into the Dremel. Success! Time to make another jig!]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[John Appleseed]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Turnouts]]></category></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.example.com/2017/2017-01-21-first-turnout-jig</guid><title>A Turnout Jig</title><link>https://www.example.com/2017/2017-01-21-first-turnout-jig</link><description><![CDATA[After building 3 turnouts I have been thinking a bit on how to speed up their construction.
